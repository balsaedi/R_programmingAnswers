# Capstone Project
## Introduction
### Project Overview and Objectives 
- The main objective of this capstone project is to allow the student apply all the skills and techniques learned through the camp in a comprehensive real-world analysis.

- It greatly emphasizes on teamwork, critical thinking and creativity

### Group Formation
Participants are divided into 5 groups, each consisting of 5 members.
Each group is assigned a different data set. These are the  proposed data sets and their links to download them:


1. **Healthcare Data set**

## Project Planning
### Defining the problem statement
Using your assigned data set, you will be required to;

- define a clear problem statement to address. 
- narrow down on the scope of the project to make it manageable within the given timeframe
- outline your project goals and the expected outcomes 


### Planning the Analysis WorkFlow 
In your groups, you are required to plan the analysis including:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

You will identify potential issues for instance missing values and outliers ,then plan how to address them 

* **Explanatory Data Analysis**

Plan how to conduct the initial exploration of the data set to understand the data structure and key patterns

* **Model Selection and Application**

Discuss on the potential statistical or machine learning models that could be applied to the data 

* **Evaluation and Interpretation**

Plan how to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and interpret the results.


## Project Execution
### Part 1
#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
The groups will begin by cleaning and preparing the data sets including;

- Handling missing values
- Correcting inconsistencies in the data set
- Ensuring data is ready for analysis 

The instructirs will provide support and guidance as needed, answering questions and help in troubleshooting issues

#### Explanatory Data Analysis(EDA)

The groups will then;

- Perform EDA to uncover insights, identify trends and explore the relationships between variables 
- Visualize the data using `ggplot2` or any other tool to better understand the data.
- Document their findings and decide on the next step in the analysis 

### Part 2
#### Model Building and Analysis 
Each group is required to; 

- Select and apply an appropriate statistical or machine learning model to address their research questions 
- Train, test and fine-tune the model as needed. 
- Emphasize on the interpreting the model outputs, understanding the implications and ensuring the results align with the project goals 

#### Evaluation and Insights
The groups will then; 

- evaluate the performance of their models using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall).
- discuss on the insights gained from the analysis and how these insights could be applied in a real-world context.
- prepare visualizations and summary reports to effectively communicate their findings.

## Project Presentations and Feedback
Each group will finally present their project that will include; 

- An overview of the data set and the problem statement.
- The steps taken during data cleaning, EDA, and model building.
- The key findings, model performance, and final insights.
- Visualizations and any actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
